Neopixel
========

Some neopixel scripts that I have adapted from Adafruit and other sources to make my neopixel crap run. Primarily, these use a ATTiny85. 

Ideas have been cobbled together from an Instructable by danasf (http://www.instructables.com/id/Use-a-1-ATTiny-to-drive-addressable-RGB-LEDs/?ALLSTEPS), the Adafruit NeoPixel UberGuide by Phillip Burgess (http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/overview), the Adafruit NeoPixel Library (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel), and finally the nifty work done by EternalCore in the Adafruit forums (http://www.adafruit.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=42204). EternalCore graciously shared his work. For EternalCore's NeoPixel code you can pick it up here (https://github.com/EternalCore/NeoPixel_Cylon_Scrolling_Eye).
